<h1>Hi there and welcome to my GitHub pageðŸ‘‹<h1>

My name is Jean-Robert and I am from Palm Bay, FL.  I am a proud data-holic and always learning something new in the data science universe.  I have worked on quite a few interesting projects, and some of them you might even find interesting.  I love when data gives me that 'ah hah moment!' And even better when a ML algorithm I tuned scores high of the validation and test set! I have my sights set on kaggle competitions and continually honing my skills in order to create the perfect, or rather yet, the near perfect model ðŸ˜„ to solve real world problems.


- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on kaggle Data Science projects.
